# The Anti-Social Network
(GA project 2)

# Social Media, Better!
use this wonderful creation to write your over-long opinions and post them where no one can avoid looking at them!

# More Scrolling, More Better!
Prepare yourself for a whole new workout! Endlessly scrolling from the first posts ever posted, to wherever in the order your semantic garbage ends up.

# Even Better Than More Better!
No searchbar?! No problem! Look for your favorite posts through hardwork and deteremination instead of lazy keyword searches or algorithmic sorting!

# No Lurking Tolerated!
Log in or get out, take responsibility for your words!
